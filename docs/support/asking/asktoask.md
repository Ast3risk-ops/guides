# :symbols-raised-hand: Don't ask to ask

This is pretty simple to understand. Don't ask *if* someone can solve your problem, ask about the problem.

## Problem

As an example, if someone asks:

> Any Windows experts around?

they're actually asking:

> Any Windows experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually related to Windows or if someone who doesn't know anything about Windows could actually answer my question?


!!! quote ""
    There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking.
     
    You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way) common sense.

It could also mean:

> I have a question about Windows but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it.

which means the user is simply really lazy. so if they can't ask their question properly, why should we try to help them solve it?

## Solution

**Just ask.**

Someone who is idling on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going on is unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question, but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.
